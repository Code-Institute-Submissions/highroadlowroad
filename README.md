The steps I took in order to deploy this site to GitHub pages were as follows:

* I then selected the 'Settings' tab, seen above the contents list of the repository.
* Scrolling down to the GitHub Pages subheading near the bottom of the page.
* When clicking on the dropdown menu box, and changing the option from "none" to "Master Branch".

## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The colour theme chosen to style the included content was generated by Coolors. The colour palette was sampled against the animated logo,
and resulted in 'Persian Green' for the "HighRoad" portion of the name, and 'Maximum Yellow Red' for the "LowRoad" portion. This theme was then
carried on throughout, with highlighted words carrying emphasised intonation, in 'Light Coral'.

### Typography
All font styles were extracted from Google Fonts. The title, HighRoadLowRoad, has been formatted with the font 'Montserrat Subrayada'. Throughout 
the site, a consistent implementation of only two fonts were used. 'Raleway' was used against all heading and subheading elements, and 'Montserrat 
Alternates' against the text content and navigation links. Sans Serif was used as a substitute where the aforementioned custom fonts were not supported 
by selected browsers or devices.

### Imagery
With imagery being vital for user experience, original images owned by William Marjoribanks, were applied as background images. They could be altered
using a custom radio button, within the lower footer of the site. This was not kept in local storage, as the site was not prioritised as a themeable site, 
however was included to give the option of rural and urban imagery, likely to be seen whilst travelling throughout Scotland. 

On scrolling, the background images, were set to a fixed position, of the browser window - excluding of course the scrollbar - to give the illusion that 
the text content was moving <em>around</em> the images.

### Wireframes
The wireframes created at the beginning of the project and used as a reference throughout are situated in a dedicated folder entitled ['wireframes'](...), 
at the same level as the homepage, 'index.html'. It contains screenshot images, for both the Mobile, Tablet and Desktop viewport screen sizes, due to the use
of Bootstrap, and the prioritisation on Mobile-first devices.
