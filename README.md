# High Road Low Road

## Description

Welcome to High Road Low Road, an online resource website that has been designed to highlight the spectacles a vacation could include. It utilises Google Maps to visually provide the user with an 
understanding of the attractions, sights, and accommodation which may be beneficial on a trip to rural or urban Scotland.

## Deployment

This website has been deployed to Github pages and can be accessed by [clicking here.](https://lhbank.github.io/highroadlowroad/)

The steps I took to deploy this site to GitHub pages were as follows:

* I first selected the chosen repository, in this case, "HighRoadLowRoad".
* I then selected the 'Settings' tab, seen above the contents list of the repository.
* Scrolling down to the GitHub Pages subheading near the bottom of the page.
* When clicking on the dropdown menu box, and changing the option from "none" to "Master Branch".
* Once this page has automatically refreshed on changing this option, scroll down to the same Github Pages subheading, which now has a green highlighted box, confirming that the site has been published.

## User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

* As a returning user to the site, I want to understand the designation of the colour coded markers with those of the markers on the interactive map.

### Frequent User Goals
* As a frequent user of the site, it is important that I be able to check for more recent testimonials published on the site, about the service HighRoadLowRoad
provide, as well as their presence and reputation within travel and tourism.

## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The colour theme chosen to style the included content was generated by Coolors. The colour palette was sampled against the animated logo
and resulted in 'Persian Green' for the "HighRoad" portion of the name, and 'Maximum Yellow Red' for the "LowRoad" portion. This theme was then
carried on throughout, with highlighted words carrying emphasised intonation, in 'Light Coral'.

### Typography
All font styles were extracted from Google Fonts. The title, HighRoadLowRoad, has been formatted with the font 'Montserrat Subrayada'. Throughout the site, consistent implementation of 
only two fonts was used. 'Raleway' was used against all heading and subheading elements, and 'Montserrat Alternates' against the text content and navigation links. Sans Serif was used 
as a substitute where the aforementioned custom fonts were not supported by selected browsers or devices.

### Imagery
With imagery being vital for user experience, original images owned by William Marjoribanks were applied as background images. They could be altered
using a custom radio button, within the lower footer of the site. This was not kept in local storage, as the site was not prioritised as a themeable site, 
however, was included to give the option of rural and urban imagery, likely to be seen whilst travelling throughout Scotland. 

On scrolling, the background images were set to a fixed position, of the browser window - excluding of course the scrollbar - to give the illusion that 
the text content was moving <em>around</em> the images.

### Wireframes
The wireframes created at the beginning of the project and used as a reference throughout are situated in a dedicated folder entitled ['wireframes'](...), 
at the same level as the homepage, 'index.html'. It contains screenshot images, for both the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop viewport screen sizes, due to the use
of Bootstrap, and the prioritisation on Mobile-first devices.

# Features
* Interactive Google Map.
* Interactive links to related social media networks.
* Contact Form.

# Technologies Used
* [ScrollReveal](https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal) - This open-source project listed in deployed GitHub pages, allowed elements within each section of the site 
to respond to the user scrolling down the page for the first time. The elements would enter the browser window from different viewpoints. This was used with 
Javascript and kept in a separate Javascript file from that of the Google Maps syntax, for clarity.

## Languages Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript - Used within various key elements of the site, including Navbar, Collapse, Dropdown Menu, Carousel, Buttons. It was also used for the animated elements of
the site, such as the Animated Site Logo and Scroll Reveal Utility.
* Google API used in line with Javascript to create an interactive element which displayed image markers, representing locations 
throughout Scotland.

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
* [Bootstrap 4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap was utilised as a framework for CSS used throughout the site.
* [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) - Used for the navigation elements on Carousel elements used on the site.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used as a Javascript library by Bootstrap.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - GitHub was utilised for version control of the site.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - Gitpod was used over the duration of this site, as a virtual workspace environment.
* [WireframeCC](https://wireframe.cc/) - This service was utilised to create sample wireframe guides to structure the content to be displayed on the site.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google Fonts was chosen to supply all fonts used throughout the site.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - FontAwesome was used for icons used in the footer.
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) - Materialize was used for the 'Hamburger' menu item at the top of the page.
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - This service, was used to generate a colour palette which would be used against all elements in a consistent theme throughout
 the site.
* Lightroom 4 - Pre-installed photography editing software used to compress the images used throughout the gallery pages.
* [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - was used to further compress all images used throughout the site.
* [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) - This tool was used to enable the user to contact the author/owner of the site, via a contact form on the Contact page.
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This application was used to create an animated SVG that used Javascript on the initial loading of the site only.
* [ScrollReveal](https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal) - This open-source project listed in deployed GitHub pages, allowed elements within each section of the site to 
respond to the user scrolling. The elements would then enter the browser window from different areas. This was used with Javascript.

# Testing

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a first time user, I was able to see that the site used strong imagery to highlight key attractions within Scotland.
* As a first time user, I was able to navigate with ease throughout the site using the navbar at the head of the page, to each
dedicated section and had options linked to third-party sites.
* As a first time user, I was able to click on the social media links in the contact section of the site, via dedicated logos which I 
recognised immediately.

### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a returning user, I was able to click on colourful customised interactive markers on the map, placed in the "Adventure" section of the site, and understand their relevance. 
This made for ease of use and was familiar with how to control the map for my own purposes.
* As a returning user, I was able to send a message to the owner of HRLR to ascertain more information about a recommended attraction, advertised on the 
featured Google Map.

### Frequent User Goals
* As a frequent user of the site, I liked the functionality of the interchangeable background images, which portrayed the different landscapes to be experienced, from
rural to urban, and would like to see more options in the future. I would also like the option to purchase these images as prints.
* As a frequent user, I know that if required, I can contact the site owner, via the contact form to enquire about attractions and listed highlights as to whether
they are deemed as safe and in line with government guidelines regarding the current COVID19 situation.

## Further Testing

### Error Resolution

During the final development stages of the HighRoadLowRoad project, an error presented itself which prevented the custom markers from displaying on the interactive Google Map.

Initially, on inspection and research, it was revealed that issues can arise if the markers aren't added to the initialised map variable within the relevant Javascript file.
However, on testing this theory before committing and pushing the changes to the master branch, found that wasn't the case. Instead, what needed to be amended 
was the location of the marker images whilst being processed by the for loop. This was the following result in the deployed site:

Simple errors such as this were overlooked, however, are fundamental to the User Experience.

### Scalability
Ideas to further develop the site's seamless use, and better user experience, would be to include radio buttons, which, using Javascript could
interact with the Google Maps API. For example, labelling two radio buttons: "City Life" and "Rural Life", then, when selecting the respective button, the relevant markers 
would appear on the Google Map. What would also benefit the sight is to include an API which allowed for the user to organise 
UK-wide travel arrangements, to be able to reach the destinations highlighted on the interactive Google Map.

### Speed Testing
To measure the speed of the site's loading, I used GTMetrix. [Clicking on this link](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/lhbank.github.io/xDU0IArs/), 
will open a new window with the report attached to HighRoadLowRoad.

## Content
The process for me to create a functioning site, inclusive of Javascript, required a great deal of extra research into understanding how to best serve the site's purpose. This meant
watching various tutorials and reading varied and detailed documentation for inspiration. The following were used:

* [Animated site-logo tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJNVramny9k) - A YouTube tutorial published by DevEd, which incorporated the use of Figma to create
a unique animated logo.
* [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/) - assisted in breaking down aspects of Javascript into more digestible parts.
* [Google Maps API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) - A thorough reference to the Google Maps API documentation, was crucial throughout the 
implementation of the interactive map on HighRoadLowRoad.
